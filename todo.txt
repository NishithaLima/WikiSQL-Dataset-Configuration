for row summary

read first column
filter out very low entropy value column
filter out hyphenated columns and doesnt apply to first column
aggregate same values of two columns with same value
replace underscores by spaces and remove the parenthesis and text inside parenthesis
if a cell has a lot of text and we dont read it


for column summary
1. if its text and low entropy, 
the column name has value yes with prob "this" and similar...
if prob is smaller than 10% we group them to others
resort

2. say the column names as the similar way to row

3. "this column has this number of unique values starting from this to this"
applies to high entropy text column

4. for numeric field
if small precision
then say say number of unique values

if precision is large 
say low high and median

6. for text, if the column has large value then drop the values. if empty then say cannot generate summary



for whole table
summarize the first column first

then rank columns by entropy
summarize the low entropy columns and for the rest just say the col name
